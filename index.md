Catching and throwing are important skills developed by human beings, and are pervasive in human teamwork, recreation, and athletics. The catching and throwing abilities, such as catching a ball, or throwing a bag of crisps to a friend, enable the passing of an object from one person to another to be efficient. Such abilities, once properly learned by a robot, can accelerate the transfer of an object by a robot to another robot or a person, and also enable the transfer to be completed in a more precise manner. Understanding and modelling how humans catch and throw an object can therefore advance the development of more dexterous and responsive robots, as well as better human-robot collaboration.
